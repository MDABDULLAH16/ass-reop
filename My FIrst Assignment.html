            <p>Non-medical masks are still required in all campus spaces unless you’re eating or drinking, alone in an
                office, residence room or cubicle or walking outdoors. This means you’ve got to keep them on in labs,
                classrooms, common areas and hallways.

                Wearing your mask helps you protect those around you from the spread of viruses (and helps you out,
                too), so do your part so we can all keep each other safe and healthy.</p>
